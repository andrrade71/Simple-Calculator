# Simple Web Calculator

A straightforward web-based calculator built using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This project serves as a practical example of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic arithmetic logic implementation on the front-end.

## Features

* Performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).
* Clear display functionality (C button).
* Responsive dark theme interface.
* Visual feedback (slight scaling animation) on button clicks.
* Basic error handling for division by zero (shows an alert).
* Supports basic chained operations (e.g., `5 * 3 + 2 =`).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure of the calculator.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Grid, Flexbox), dark theme, and click animations (pseudo-classes, transitions).
* **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, performing calculations, and manipulating the DOM.





## Possible Future Improvements

* Add keyboard support for input.
* Implement decimal point (.) functionality.
* Include more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, percentage, memory functions).
* Display a calculation history.
* Improve error handling and display messages more elegantly than `alert()`.
* Refactor JavaScript code (e.g., using classes or modules) for better organization, especially if adding more features.
